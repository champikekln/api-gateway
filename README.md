api gateway using Ocelot

What is an API Gateway?
An API Gateway is a server that acts as a central entry point for all client requests to a system's microservices or backend APIs. It simplifies and manages communication between clients and services by performing various tasks, including:

Request Routing: Directing client requests to the appropriate services.
Load Balancing: Distributing requests across multiple service instances.
Authentication and Authorization: Ensuring secure access to services.
Rate Limiting: Preventing overuse or abuse of APIs.
Caching: Improving performance by storing frequently accessed data.
What is Ocelot?
Ocelot is an open-source API Gateway specifically built for the .NET ecosystem. It provides powerful features like routing, rate limiting, load balancing, authentication, and caching to simplify the management of microservices in a .NET application.
